15:43:42	 From Joe Allen : Great!
15:43:42	 From Breanna Crandall : ;-; I'm finally famous guys.
15:44:40	 From Laura Huerta-Del Real : usedCandles has to increment too
15:44:40	 From Gabriel Ruelas : who are you again? (I'm sorry)
15:44:41	 From Daniel Dorantes Valdez : candlesINBox-1
15:44:42	 From Ryan Ly to Frank Vahid (Privately) : numCandles - usedCandles
15:44:42	 From Kobe Braga : numCandlesInBox = numCandlesInBox - 5;
15:44:43	 From Christopher : numCandlesInBox - 5
15:44:46	 From sassine : Subtract 5
15:44:48	 From Claire Wun : numCandlesInBox-5
15:44:48	 From Laura Huerta-Del Real : decrement*
15:45:27	 From mattogrady : Are we allowed to use the increment shortcuts like +=
15:46:05	 From Joe Allen : For all that don't know what += is, we can talk about it in lab tonight!
15:46:13	 From Nikita Horunzhy : so everything inside the { } is part of the while loop correct?
15:46:13	 From Ryan Ly : 10
15:46:16	 From Kobe Braga : 10

15:46:22	 From Nischal Gautam : 10
15:46:23	 From Caitlin De La Torre : 10
15:46:38	 From Joe Allen : It's called the loop body!
15:47:01	 From Nikita Horunzhy : Makes sense
15:47:03	 From Caitlin De La Torre : the loop body is what is in the { } ??
15:47:14	 From Joe Allen : Yes @Caitlin
15:47:15	 From Daniel Dorantes Valdez : Yeah
15:47:23	 From Prayag : shouldn't it be <=?
15:47:32	 From Ryan Ly to Frank Vahid (Privately) : Do you know why my text doesn‚Äôt turn blue and also when I press return , it doesn‚Äôt start a new line under the previous line but all the way towards the left
15:47:52	 From Merrick Slane : if it's equal then they don't have any more though
15:47:52	 From Claudia Duarte : im so late, was there a survey?
15:48:01	 From Joe Allen : Let me grab it, one moment
15:48:10	 From Claudia Duarte : thanks
15:48:25	 From Joe Allen : https://forms.gle/e6uTs8btda1BvnnT6

15:52:58	 From Christopher : are we going to go over the difference between ++i and i++?
15:54:11	 From Breanna Crandall : Pretty much the same! It's cool that it translated since I used Coral
15:54:15	 From BrianTaylor : no questions
15:54:17	 From Samuel : nope
15:54:18	 From Cassandra Castor : makes sense
15:54:42	 From ethan : I did this 
15:54:47	 From Christopher : usedCandles can be considered running sum
15:54:49	 From ethan : while (numCandles >= numBdays) {      numBdays += 1;      numCandles -= numBdays;   }
15:54:53	 From Davis Thuillier : Create function for triangular numbers and increment by the term of that corresponding to the birthday.
15:54:53	 From Prayag : since you don't get candles on the zeroth birthday, does this really work?
15:55:13	 From BrianTaylor : yep
15:55:36	 From Breanna Crandall : Aww thank you!

16:05:14	 From Laura Huerta-Del Real : oh dear @joe
16:05:43	 From Alison G. : no but can we do this also in windows?

16:12:14	 From Garland : can you srand(rand())
16:12:29	 From Kobe Braga : I think she meant if you make your own functions, do you have to use stand in those?
16:13:01	 From Amy : Sorry I meant if you called a function inside of main and then in that function's statement you use rand, will it still be the seeded random number in the main?
16:13:42	 From Amy : ok thanks!
16:14:23	 From Kobe Braga : Time
